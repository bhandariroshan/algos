To find the files, I used recursion. First I defined the function called find_files. This function takes directory as input, reads all the files/folders in the directory. Then for each item found, if the item is directory it recursively calls the find files. Else, if the item is a file, it adds the item to the list of solution and returns. Final output is the aggregation of the recursive calls of all the items. The function calls os.listdir, this operation takes O(n) complexity. In our case, there are 1 main folder, 5 subfodlers and 1 sub sub folder, so in total there are 6 os.lsitdir call. Then for each file in each result of os.listdir I am checking if the element is a file or a folder, this operation in for loop takes O(n) time to make the recursive call, O(n) time to check if the element is a folder or not, another O(n) to check if it is a file and O(n)  to append the element to the list. So in total the function makes O(10n) which is O(n) complexity.
