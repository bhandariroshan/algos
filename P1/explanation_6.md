To find the union and intersection of the 2 linked list I am using set. I travel each of the linkedlist and construct 2 sets. The traversal in linked list takes O(n) complexity. Once a set complexity is calculated, union is found using set.union function. Since the set has internal implementation as a hash table, each get operation takes O(1) time complexity so the overall complexity of the union and intersection operation is O(n). Hence the overall complexity of both the operation is O(n).
