Time Complexity: To find the union and intersection of the 2 linked list I am using set. I travel each of the linkedlist and construct 2 sets. The traversal in linked list takes O(n) complexity. Once a set complexity is calculated, union is found using set.union function. Since the set has internal implementation as a hash table, each get operation takes O(1) time complexity so the overall complexity of the union and intersection operation is O(n). Hence the overall complexity of both the operation is O(n). 


Space Complexity: I am using 2 sets to store the elements of linked list. At worst case both the linked list can be independent and having unique elements, as such 2n space would be required to store the elements of the linked list. Hence the worst case space complexity of the code is O(2n) i.e O(n).
