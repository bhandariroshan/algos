For this problem, I am using 2 dictionaries, order and data. Dictionary data has data and its order stored whereas dictinoary order has data saved by order i.e order as key and data as value. The 2 reverse dictionaries are maintained so that I can set and get in O(1) worst case time complexity. There are also 3 more variables to keep track of number of spaces filled, highest order and lowest order of data. In get operation, for the data that is get, its order is increased simultaneously in both the order and data dict. Whereas in set operation, if the capacity is reached, the lowest order element is deleted and the lowest order is updated. At the highest order, new element is set. All the operations are in dictionary and it is constant time operation so the overall complexity of both the set and get operation is O(1).
