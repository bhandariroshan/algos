To solve this problem, I am using recurion. A recursive function named is_user_in_group is made. This function, first check if the user is in the memer list in the group. If found it returns true. This operation takes O(n) for n members in the group. Otherwise, it has to recursively check all the sub groups and all the members. If there are m such groups in total and n members in each group. Then it has to check all the n*m groups to find if the user is present or not. As such overall complexity of the code is: O(m*n).
