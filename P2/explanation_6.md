For this problem, I am using 2 variables min and max. I traverse across the array checking if the current element is lesser than the min, if yes I update the min. I also check if the current element is greater than the max, if yes I update the max. In the end min and max will both be discovered. Hence the overall complexity of this process O(n) single traversal.
