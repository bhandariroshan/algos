For this problem, I figured out that the largest sum of numbers would be generated by 2 numebrs that are combination of numbers in odd position or even position in a sorted array. For example, in an array [2, 5, 7, 8, 9] largest number would be sum of 972 and 85. Hence, the first task would be to sort the input array. To sort this array I am using merge sort, which has a complexity of O(nlog(n)). Once the input array is sorted, a traversal is made in that array generating the 2 final numbers. This traversal is linear in nature. Hence the overall complexity of the algorithm is O(nlog(n)).
